Q1.Write a Python Program to check if the given number is a Disarium Number?
ANS:# Function to check if a given number is a Disarium Number
def isDisariumNumber(num):
# Convert the number to a string to calculate its length
num_str = str(num)
# Initialize sum variable
sum =

# Calculate the sum of each digit raised to the power of its position
for i in range(len(num_str)):
sum += int(num_str[i]) ** (i+1)

# Check if the sum is equal to the original number
if sum == num:
return True
else:
return False

# Input number from user
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Call the function and print the result
if isDisariumNumber(num):
print(f"{num} is a Disarium Number")
else:
print(f"{num} is not a Disarium Number")

Q2.Write a Python Program to print all disarium numbers between 1 to 100?
ANS:```python
def calculateLength(n):
length =
while(n != ):
length = length + 1
n = n//10
return length

def isDisariumNumber(num):
temp = num
sum =

# Calculate the number of digits in the given number
len = calculateLength(num)

while(temp > ):
digit = temp % 10

# Add each digit raised to the power of its position in the number to get the sum
sum += digit ** len

# Move to the next digit by dividing by 10 and decrease length by 1 for next iteration.
temp //= 10
len -= 1

# If sum is equal to original number, it's a disarium number. Return true.

if(sum == num):
return True

# Print all disarium numbers between range(1,100)
print("Disarium numbers between range(1,100): ")
for i in range(1,101):
if(isDisariumNumber(i)):
print(i)
```

Output:
```
Disarium numbers between range(1,100):
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
89

Q3.Write a Python program to check if the given number is Happy Number?
ANS:Here's a Python program to check if a given number is a Happy Number:

```python
def is_happy_number(num):
seen = set()
while num != 1 and num not in seen:
seen.add(num)
num = sum(int(digit)**2 for digit in str(num))
return num == 1

# Test the function
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if is_happy_number(number):
print(f"{number} is a Happy Number")
else:
print(f"{number} is not a Happy Number")
```

Q4.Write a Python program to print all happy number between 1 and 100?
ANS:```python
def is_happy(n):
seen = set()
while n != 1:
n = sum(int(i)**2 for i in str(n))
if n in seen:
return False
else:
seen.add(n)
return True

happy_numbers = [i for i in range(1, 101) if is_happy(i)]
print("Happy numbers between 1 and 100:", happy_numbers)
```

Output:
```
Happy numbers between 1 and 100: [1, 7, 10, 13, 19, 23, ...]
```

Q5.Write a Python program to determine whether the given number is a Harshad Number?
ANS:# Function to determine whether a number is a Harshad Number
def is_harshad_number(num):
# Calculate the sum of the digits of the number
sum_of_digits = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(num))

# Check if the number is divisible by its sum of digits
if num % sum_of_digits == :
return True
else:
return False

# Get input from user
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Check if the given number is a Harshad Number
if is_harshad_number(num):
print(f"{num} is a Harshad Number")
else:
print(f"{num} is not a Harshad Number")
