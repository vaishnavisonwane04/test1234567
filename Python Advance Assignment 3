Q3. Describe the signification of DASK.
Ans:Dask is flexible library for parallel computing in python.Dask is composed of two parts.Dynamic task scheduling optimized for 
computation.This is similar to Airflow. Luigi,Celery,or Make, but optimized for interactive computational workloads.many software 
project integrate with Dask or use Dask to power components of their infrastructure. 



Q4.Describe the functions of DASK.
Ans:The Dask delayed function decorates your functions so that they operate lazily.Rather than executing your 
function immediately. it will defer execution, placing the function and its arguments into a task graph, wraps
a function or object to produce a Delayed. We used the dask.
