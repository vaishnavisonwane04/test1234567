Q1 What makes Numpy.shape()differnt from Numpy.size()?












Q2. In NumPy. describe the idea of broadcasting.
Ans:The term broadcasting describe how NumPy treats arrays with differnt shape during arithmetic operations.
Subject to certain constraints, the smaller arry is "broadcast" across the larger array so that they have compatible shapes.


Q3. what make Python better than other libraries for numerical computation?
Ans: One of the main advanatages of using Python for mathematics is its extensive library of numerical and scientific computing tools.
These libraries provide a range of functions and tools that make it easier to perform complex calculation s anad analysis , as well as
automate repetitive tasks.



Q4. How does NumPy deal with files?
Ans: NumPy introduces a simple file formatfor ndarray objects.This .npy file stores data, shape, dtype and ohter information required 
to reconstruct the ndarray in a disk file such that the array is correcly retrieved even if the file is on another machine with differnt archicture.


Q5.Mention the importance of NumPy.empty().
Ans: The numPy module of Python provides a function called numpy.empty(). This function is used to create an array without initializing
the entires of given shape and type. Just like numpy.zeros(), the numpy.empty()function doesn't set the array values to zero, and it is quite faster 
than the numpy.zeros().This functionrequires the user to set all the values in the array manually and shouuld be used with caution.
