Q1. what are the two values of the boolean data type ? How do you write them?
ans:
three are 2 values of Boolean data type
1.True 2.False

a = True 
b = False
print('a: ',a)
print('b: ',b)

Q2. what are the three different types of Boolean operators?
ans:
1.AND
2.OR
3.NOT

Q3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables
(i.e every possible combination of boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate)
ans:
list_AND = [1 and 1, 1 and 0, 0 and 1, 0 and 0]
list_AND

[1,0,0,0]

list_OR = [1 or 1, 1 or 0, 0 or 1, 0 or 0]
list_OR

[1, 1, 1,0]


list_NOT = [not 1, not 0]
list_NOT

[False, True]


Q4. what are the values of the following expressions?

(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)
not (5 > 4)
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
not ((5 >4) or (3 == 5))
(True and True) and (True == False)
(not False) or (not True)

ANS:
1.(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)                         = False
2. not (5 > 4)                                 = False
3.(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)                          = True
4.not ((5 >4) or (3 == 5))                     = False
5.(True and True) and (True == False)          = False
6.(not False) or (not True)                    = True


[] print((5 > 4) and (3 == 5),
        not (5 > 4),
        (5 > 4) or (3 == 5),
        (True and True) and (True == False),
        (not False) or (not True)
        )
        
        False False True False False True
        
 Q5. what are the six comparison operators?
 ans:
 1. ==:is equal to 
 2. !=:is not equal to
 3. > :is greater than
 4. >=:is greater than or equal to
 5. < :is lesss than 
 6. <= :is less than or equal to 
 
 Q6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators? Descibe a condition and when you would you one.
 ans:
 1. '=':single equal to sign is used for the assignment operation.
 2. '==':double equal to equal for the equal to condition check.
 3. when we want to assign something(eg. a = 10) we use the assignment operator. whereas when we want to check some condition(eg. 10 == 100)we use the equal to
 condition check operator.
 
 
 Q7. Identify the three blocks in ths code:
 
 spam = 0
 if spam==10:
 print('eggs')
 if spam >5:
 print('bacon')
 else:
 print('ham')
 print('spam')
 print('spam')
 ans:
 [] spam = 0
    if spam == 10:  ## Block 1
       print('eggs')
       
    if spam > 5:     ## Block 2
        print('bacon')
        else:        ## Block 3
             print('ham')
             
             print('spam')
             print('spam')
             
             ham
             spam
             spam
             
 Q8. write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam,prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam,and prints Greeting!if anything else is
 storeed in spam.
 code:
 
 [] spam = 1
 
    if spam == 1:
       print('Hello')
    elif spam == 2:
         print(Howdy')
     else:
         print('Greetings!')
         
      Hello
      
      
  Q9. If your programme is stuck in an endless loop,whata keys you'll press?
  ans:
  
  1.Press ctl+c on the command line.
  2.Restart the kernal
  
  
10.How can you tell difference between break and continue?
ans:

  1.Break:it is used to break the loop and exit from the loop
  2.continue:it is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and continue with the next itration.
  
  
  
Q11.In a for loop,what is the difference between range(10),range(0,10),and range(0, 10, 1)?
ans:
There is on difference

[] for i in range(10):
       print(i, end= ' ')
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
  
 [] for i in range(0, 10):
        print(i, end = ' ')
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
        
  [] for i in range(0, 10, 1):
         print(i, end = ' ')
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
        
        
  
  Q12.Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the 
  numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
  code:
  
  [] ## Using for loop
  
     for i in range(1, 11):
         print(i, end = ' ')
         
      1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
      
      
   [] ## Usin while loop
   
      i = 1
      while i < 11:
            print(i, end = ' ')
            i += 1
            
        1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
        
        
        
  13.If you had a function named bacon()inside a module named spam,how would you call it after importing spam?

  import spam
  spam.bacon()
